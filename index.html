<section id="what-is-java" class="main-section">
  <h1 class="one">What is Java?</h1>
  <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the Oak name to Java</p>

<section id="why-to-learn-java"class="main-section">
  <h1 class="one">Why to learn Java?</h1>
  <p>Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Java Programming:
<ul>
  <li><h4>Object Oriented</h4>In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Platform Independent</h4> Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Simple</h4> Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Secure</h4> With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Architecture-neutral</h4>Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.</li>
  <li>

    <h4>Portable</h4> Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Robust</h4> Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.</li></p>
  </ul>

<section id="applications-of-java" class="main-section">
  <h1 class="one">Applications of Java</h1><ol>
  According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:

<li>Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.</li>
<li>Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.</li>
<li>Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.</li>
<li>Mobile</li>
<li>Embedded System</li>
<li>Smart Card</li>
<li>Robotics</li>
<li>Games</li>
  </ol>
</section>
<!-- fourth section -->
<section id="types of java application"  class="main-section">
  <h1 class="one">Types of Java Application</h1>
  There are mainly 4 types of applications that can be created using Java programming:
<ul>
  <li> <h4>Standalone Application</h4></li>
Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.

  <li><h4>Web Application</h4></li>
An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.

  <li><h4>Enterprise Application</h4></li>
An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called enterprise application. It has advantages of the high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise applications.

  <li><h4>Mobile Application</h4></li>
  
An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application. Currently, Android and Java ME are used for creating mobile applications.
  </ul>
</section>
<!-- fifth section -->
<section id="java-platforms" class="main-section">
  <h1 class="one">Java Platforms/Editions</h1>
  There are 4 platforms or editions of Java:
<ul>
<li><h4>Java SE (Java Standard Edition)</li></h4>
It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.

<li><h4>Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition)</li></h4>
It is an enterprise platform which is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on the top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.

<li><h4>Java ME (Java Micro Edition)</li></h4>
It is a micro platform which is mainly used to develop mobile applications.

  <li><h4> JavaFX</li></h4>
It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a light-weight user interface API.
  </ul>
